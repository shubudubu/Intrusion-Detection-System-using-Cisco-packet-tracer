# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-Cisco-packet-tracer

Project Description:
This project involves the design and implementation of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Cisco Packet Tracer. The objective is to simulate a network environment where the IDS monitors, detects, and responds to malicious activities and unauthorized access attempts. Through this project, users can understand the fundamentals of network security, IDS functionalities, and how to configure and manage security protocols within a simulated network infrastructure.

Objectives:

Understand IDS Concepts: Gain a comprehensive understanding of how intrusion detection systems function and their role in maintaining network security.
Simulate Network Environments: Use Cisco Packet Tracer to create realistic network topologies for testing and demonstrating IDS capabilities.
Implement Security Protocols: Configure various security measures and protocols to detect and prevent common network attacks.
Analyze and Respond to Threats: Learn how to monitor network traffic, analyze intrusion alerts, and implement appropriate response strategies.
Enhance Troubleshooting Skills: Develop skills in identifying and resolving security vulnerabilities within network configurations.
Key Features:

Network Topology Design:

Multi-Layer Network Architecture: Create a layered network structure including core, distribution, and access layers to simulate a real-world enterprise network.
Diverse Network Devices: Utilize various Cisco devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, and servers to build a comprehensive network environment.
Segmentation and VLANs: Implement network segmentation using Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) to control and secure traffic flow.
Intrusion Detection Mechanisms:

Signature-Based Detection: Configure IDS to detect known attack patterns and signatures such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and denial-of-service attacks.
Anomaly-Based Detection: Set up systems to identify unusual network behavior that deviates from established baselines.
Real-Time Monitoring: Enable continuous monitoring of network traffic to promptly identify and alert on potential security breaches.
Alerting and Logging: Implement logging mechanisms to record security events and configure alerts (e.g., email notifications, syslog messages) for immediate response.
Simulating Network Attacks:

Common Attack Scenarios: Simulate various attack types including brute force attacks, malware injections, and man-in-the-middle attacks to test IDS effectiveness.
Attack Generation Tools: Use built-in Packet Tracer tools or scripted events to generate malicious traffic within the simulated network.
Response Testing: Evaluate how the IDS responds to different attack scenarios and refine configurations for optimal performance.
Security Protocols and Configurations:

Access Control Lists (ACLs): Implement ACLs to control traffic flow and restrict unauthorized access to network resources.
Secure Communication Protocols: Configure protocols like SSH, SSL/TLS, and IPsec for encrypted and secure data transmission.
Firewall Integration: Set up firewalls to work in conjunction with IDS for enhanced security and threat mitigation.
Network Address Translation (NAT): Utilize NAT to mask internal network structures and add a layer of security against external threats.
Reporting and Analysis:

Dashboard Creation: Develop dashboards within Packet Tracer or external tools to visualize network performance and security status.
Incident Reports: Generate detailed reports on detected intrusions, including timestamps, source/destination IPs, and types of attacks.
Performance Metrics: Monitor and analyze IDS performance metrics to ensure efficiency and reliability.
Implementation Steps:

Environment Setup:
